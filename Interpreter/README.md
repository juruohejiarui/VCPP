# InterpreterLinux
A simple interpreter of a language create by me. This language contains the shortcomings of both C++ and Java. !!!GC is included.

## How to use
After you download the sources, open the folder "InterpreterLinux" in visual studio code(vscode in short) in Linux or in subsystem of Linux. Make sure your vscode has already had the extensions listed below:
1. C++
2. CMake
3. CMake Tools

Then click $\texttt{F5}$ to build the project.

**Tips**: 
1. If it fail to build for the first time, you can $\texttt{F5}$ again and the building program will run smoothly.
2. There are lots of bugs in vm.cpp and objmanager.cpp. To get better reference and experience, please use my other repository named ``VM_C`` .
